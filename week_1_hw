Question 1. Understanding docker first run
Run docker with the python:3.12.8 image in an interactive mode, use the entrypoint bash.

What's the version of pip in the image?

Answer:
  docker run -it entry-point=bash python:3.12.8
  pip --version

Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose
Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?
Answer:
  hostname: db
  port: 5432 (same network inside docker-compose)

Question 3. Trip Segmentation Count
During the period of October 1st 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st 2019 (exclusive), how many trips, respectively, happened:

Up to 1 mile
In between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive),
In between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive),
In between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive),
Over 10 miles

Answer:
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN '1'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 3 THEN '1-3'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 7 THEN '3-7'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 10 THEN '7-10'
        ELSE '10+'
    END AS distance_converted,
    COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM green_taxi_trips
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN '1'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 3 THEN '1-3'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 7 THEN '3-7'
        WHEN trip_distance <= 10 THEN '7-10'
        ELSE '10+'
    END
ORDER BY distance_converted;

Question 4. Longest trip for each day
Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Use the pick up time for your calculations.
Answer: 
    SELECT 
      DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) AS truncated_date,
      max(trip_distance) AS trip_distance
    FROM green_taxi_trips
    GROUP BY DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY trip_distance desc;

Question 5. Three biggest pickup zones
Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in total_amount (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?

Consider only lpep_pickup_datetime when filtering by date.
Answer: 


with x as (
select t."total_amount", zpu."Zone" from green_taxi_trips t
LEFT JOIN
zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"

where cast(t."lpep_pickup_datetime" as date) = '2019-10-18')

select x."Zone", sum(x."total_amount") as cc
from x
group by x."Zone"
having sum(x."total_amount") > 13000
order by cc desc
;



Question 6. Largest tip
For the passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone named "East Harlem North" which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
Answer:
with x as (
select t."tip_amount", zdo."Zone" from green_taxi_trips t
LEFT JOIN
zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
LEFT JOIN
    zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"

where zpu."Zone" = 'East Harlem North')

select x."Zone", sum(x."tip_amount") as cc
from x
group by x."Zone"
order by cc desc
;
